        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jamie Min. I was born in Korea and immigrated to America with my parents when I was four years old. I am the oldest of two girls and have recently graduated high school, the small but stressful world of academics my little sister has recently entered. I attend the University of California, Riverside to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in General Psychology with minors in business administration and the Korean language. Without a mentor or a safety net behind me, I have invested in my education with countless hours of work to be able to excel in both my academics and career. My parents have set up a good life for ourselves so that we, their children, can reach our true potential as productive members of society. These long years as a student have made me hone my skills as a scholastic learner and improve my work ethic when faced with timely difficulties and hard deadlines. I have engaged peers and instructors to further my knowledge as a psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. That said, I sincerely hope to encourage many more students and teachers along the line as I broaden my horizon to teach the subject of psychology to intelligent individuals at more academic institutions.<br><br>
        I aim to pursue a dynamic and challenging career filled with reputation and adventure in my psychological field. It is my goal to be able to interact with people all over the country and all over the world. With a minor in both Business Administration and Korean, I look forward to a career that involves both academic rigor and corporal structure within a country that so greatly emphasizes the importance of learning but may often disregard the effects of strenuous mental exercise. My work focuses on driving students to relieve their stress and anxiety by spreading the mental awareness that psychology brings to the table. I believe that this can be accomplished through the instruction of basic psychological concepts in foreign countries, as well as the amendments of policies that govern our very own education systems.<br><br>
        My experience as both a full-time student and a part-time worker has allowed me the opportunity to carry the responsibility of both a student and a member of a larger entity. I am confident that I have what it takes to understand and assist students all over the country with stress and psychological duress caused by overbearing educational standards. For over 12 years I have been within the education system of America; I can personally attest to the idea that there is more that instructors and faculty can do to lessen the burden education puts on students' shoulders. I am eager to explore more of these education systems, American or otherwise, to enhance my knowledge of the academic sphere and expertly approach our own system with a psychological perspective to prepare the optimal setting for students, both academically and psychologically.
